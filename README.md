# ip-name-search
This is a project I made that automatically adds people's names and ip addresses to files as you put them. 
You can use this to check for a name corresponding to an ip address and vice versa as you put them in

#Usage

`python main.py arg1 optionalarg2`

Linux:
`python3 main.py arg1 optionalarg2`

#Arguments
First argument can be either `check` to check for corresponding strings or `add` to add strings.
Second argument is optinal, and only for debugging, use `debug` to activate.

#Dependecies
